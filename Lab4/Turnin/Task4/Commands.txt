*Note* this assumes that you are running the command as the root account on a linux box. If you are not on the root
account then the pig script file will not run and will say that the file does not exist. (it users /user/root on hdfs)

Create HDFS Directory if it doesn't already exist
hadoop fs -mkdir postcn_Lab4

Upload Jar
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <local path>/Lab4Ratio-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar postcn_Lab4/

Execute Pig Script
pig -param input=<input> -param output=<output> postcnLog.pig
